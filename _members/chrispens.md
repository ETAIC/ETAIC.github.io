description: "Ms. Aashi Goyani is a Graduate Research Assistant and M.S. thesis student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington. Her research focuses on deep learning and computer vision for autonomous systems, with particular emphasis on camera calibration, 3D reconstruction, and visual perception under real-world conditions.

She has hands-on experience in developing and deploying deep neural networks for object detection, semantic segmentation, and visual tracking. Her work integrates advanced calibration techniques with learning-based perception models to improve spatial understanding and system accuracy in robotics and autonomous platforms. Aashi is also experienced in multi-sensor data processing, including LiDAR-camera fusion and visual-inertial odometry, enabling precise localization and mapping in dynamic environments.

Her goal is to bridge the gap between perception algorithms and practical deployment, building intelligent systems that are both accurate and reliable for real-time applications.
