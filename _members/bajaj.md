description: "
Dr. Zhang is a Research Associate at University of Texas at Arlington working with [Prof. Eric Tseng](https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?user=hongtei.tseng#Publications) (member of the National Academy of Engineering), and the Associate Director of the ETAIC (Embodied Technology for Autonomy, Intelligence, and Control) Research Lab. He is currently conducting postdoctoral research in the [Safe AI Lab](https://safeai-lab.github.io/) at Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Prof. Ding Zhao](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/zhao-ding.html). He received his Ph.D. from School of Vehicle and Mobility at Tsinghua University, co-advised by [Prof. Zhi Wang](https://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/74/1854.html) and [Prof. Shengbo Eben Li](https://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/80/1812.html).


He was the recipient of the Outstanding Ph.D. Graduate title, the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation award, and the “Shuimu Scholar” talent program at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2024. His doctoral research directly contributed to the successful industry deployment of reinforcement learning methods in developing advanced driver-assistance systems and energy management systems, significantly enhancing the operational efficiency of connected and automated vehicles. Notably, the control systems he developed have been implemented in leading automotive companies such as [BYD Auto](https://www.byd.com/us), [Dongfeng Motor](https://www.dongfeng-global.com/), [SAIC Motor](https://www.saicmotor.com/english/index.shtml), and start-up automotive companies such as [Hybot](http://www.hybot.com.cn/). 


Hao has authored over 30 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers and am a co-inventor on more than 20 patents. His current research focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning theory, the integration of large language models with closed-loop control, and human–robot collaboration using game theory. He aims to advance AI agents for real-world deployment in autonomous systems (including robotics and vehicles) and distributed energy systems.
