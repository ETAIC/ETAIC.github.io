description: "Prof. Tseng is a distinguished university professor in the University of Texas at Arlington. He received his B.S. degree from National Taiwan University in 1986. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Berkeley in 1991 and 1994, respectively, all in Mechanical Engineering.

In 1994, he joined Ford Motor Company. At Ford (1994-2022), he had a productive career and retired as a Senior Technical Leader of Controls and Automated Systems in Research and Advanced Engineering. Many of his contributed technologies led to production vehicles implementation, including vehicle state estimation and fault detection for Ford and Volvo Roll Stability Control system; advanced modeling and control strategy for fast skip-downshift on Ford F150 10R transmissions; lateral control enhancement for lane centering on Ford Lightning and F150 with BlueCruise; and trailer angle estimation for Pro Trailer Backup Assist on Ford Super Duty. His technical achievements have been honored with Ford's highest annual technology award, the Henry Ford Technology Award, unprecedentedly on seven occasions. Additionally, he was the recipient of the prestigious Control Engineering Practice Award from the American Automatic Control Council in 2013.

He is UTA’s first hire under the Recruiting Innovative Scholars for Excellence initiative, RISE 100. He has decades of experience in the automotive industry and more than 100 U.S. patents to his name, about a third of which have been implemented in Ford vehicles. He is also the author/coauthor of over 150 publications, including 6 book chapters. He has helped develop vehicle technology that has improved self-driving capabilities and reduced the chances of rollover accidents.

He is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE). Membership in NAE—which honors professionals who have made outstanding and innovative contributions to the research, practice, education or advancement of engineering—is among the highest professional distinctions awarded in the field."
