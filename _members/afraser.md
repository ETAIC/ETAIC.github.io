description: "Prof. Tseng is a Distinguished University Professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, and established the [ETAIC (Embodied Technology for Autonomy, Intelligence, and Control) Research Lab](https://etaic.github.io/). He is a member of the [U.S. National Academy of Engineering](https://www.nae.edu/), recognized for his [contributions to intelligent vehicle control and automotive systems integration](https://www.nae.edu/248787/Dr-Hongtei-E-Tseng).
<br><br>
He received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from National Taiwan University in 1986, and his M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1991 and 1994, respectively.
<br><br>
After joining [Ford Motor Company](https://www.ford.com/) in 1994 as a product design engineer in chassis engineering, he transitioned in 1998 to Ford Research and Advanced Engineering, where he focused on vehicle system control. Over his 28-year career at Ford, he led the development of key technologies that were deployed across production vehicles. These include vehicle state estimation for roll stability control, fast skip-downshift logic for F-150’s 10-speed transmission, lateral control algorithms for [BlueCruise](https://www.ford.com/technology/bluecruise/?gclid=CjwKCAjwpMTCBhA-EiwA_-Msmdx9ZV7zAJaBOhxeXeA2EjBH6QUx8guele3aM6kcA_JgrBVnPn_mBBoCKwQQAvD_BwE&searchid=21152174080|165751456772||&searchid=21152174080|165751456772|kwd-318641293842&fcid=pse_21152174080_google&ef_id=CjwKCAjwpMTCBhA-EiwA_-Msmdx9ZV7zAJaBOhxeXeA2EjBH6QUx8guele3aM6kcA_JgrBVnPn_mBBoCKwQQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!2519!3!695405040882!e!!g!!bluecruise!21152174080!165751456772&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21152174080) lane centering, and trailer angle estimation for Pro Trailer Backup Assist. From 2017 to 2022, he served as Senior Technical Leader of Controls and Automated Systems, one of Ford’s highest technical positions.
<br><br>
He received seven Henry Ford Technology Awards, the company’s top technical honor, for innovations ranging from traction control to driveline torque management and trailer assist systems. In 2013, he was awarded the [Control Engineering Practice Award](https://a2c2.org/) by the American Automatic Control Council for impactful real-world control applications.
<br>
He joined UTA as the first faculty under the [RISE 100 initiative](https://www.uta.edu/hr/rise100-overview), bringing decades of industrial expertise to academia and continuing his research at the intersection of control theory, robotics, and transportation systems.
<br><br>

Prof. Tseng holds over 100 U.S. patents, with around one-third implemented in production vehicles, and has published more than 150 technical papers, including several book chapters. His work has significantly advanced vehicle safety, automation, and intelligent mobility technologies.
