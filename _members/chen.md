description: "Mr. Panchal is a Graduate Research Assistant and M.S. thesis student in Electrical Engineering, specializing in autonomous vehicle research. His work focuses on artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision, object detection, lane detection, semantic segmentation, SLAM, and real-time perception for self-driving systems. He develops intelligent navigation and control frameworks that combine data-driven learning with robust system behaviour. 


His engineering experience includes embedded systems, bare-metal programming, real-time 
operating environments, robotic middleware, and sensor fusion for perception and control. He designs and implements full-stack autonomous systems that integrate AI algorithms with reliable low-level execution. 


Previously, he contributed to research at the [Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)](https://www.isro.gov.in/), where he worked on embedded software and Linux-based systems for mission-critical applications."
