# Welcome to the ETAIC Lab!
{: .display-4}
<br>
The **ETAIC** **(Embodied Technology for Autonomy, Intelligence, and Control)** Research Lab is led by [Professor H. Eric Tseng](https://www.nae.edu/248787/Dr-Hongtei-E-Tseng), a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE). Research in the lab is focused on developing embodied AI agents that integrate reinforcement learning, modern control theory, and game-theoretic approaches to enable next-generation micro-mobility devices (including assistive and mobile robots) and connected and automated vehicles.

Our work spans frontier topics such as multi-agent reinforcement learning, large language models with closed-loop control capabilities, and trustworthy autonomy in human-cyber-physical systems. To bridge theory with real-world deployment, the ETAIC Lab places strong emphasis on experimental validation. We are equipped with a comprehensive suite of robotic platforms and test facilities, including humanoid robots, wheeled robots, scaled autonomous vehicles, robotic arms, and UAVs. These are supported by a high-precision 3D motion capture system and dedicated indoor and outdoor netted drone arenas.

We are located in the Engineering Research Building (ERB) at the University of Texas at Arlington.
