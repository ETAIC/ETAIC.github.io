[Multi-Scale Reinforcement Learning of Dynamic Energy Controller for Connected Electrified Vehicles](https://www.techrxiv.org/users/692350/articles/1184096-multi-scale-reinforcement-learning-of-dynamic-energy-controller-for-connected-electrified-vehicles?commit=cd309bc80017f735b83292e39179ef3815d2cbe2)

**Hao Zhang**, Nuo Lei, Shengbo Eben Li, Junzhi Zhang, Zhi Wang

- Given the intricate coupling of mechanical, electrical, thermal dynamics and driving cycles, automotive energy control becomes high-dimensional and complex. This study proposes a multi-horizon reinforcement learning (MHRL) featuring a novel state representation and coordinated training of sub-networks across multiple time scales, which greatly improves fuel economy in real-world driving.

[Theory-Constrained Neural Network with Modular Interpretability for Fuel Cell Vehicle Modelling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852019)

Nuo Lei, **Hao Zhang*** (Corresponding Author), Hong Wang, Zunyan Hu, Hu Chen, Jingjing Hu, Zhi Wang

[**Industrial Collaborator: Hybot**](http://www.hybot.com.cn/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- This paper proposes a theory-constrained neural network (TCNN) that integrates physical principles without sacrificing accuracy. A theory-guided filter ensures sub-module interpretability, and sub-networks are individually trained under theoretical constraints with a CNN-BiLSTM-MHSA architecture enhances overall accuracy. Results demonstrate significant improvements in fitting accuragy for fuel cell modeling.

[Coupled velocity and energy management optimization of connected hybrid electric vehicles for maximum collective efficiency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261924001752?via%3Dihub)

**Hao Zhang**, Boli Chen, Nuo Lei, Bingbing Li, Chaoyi Chen, Zhi Wang

- This paper proposes an efficient nested parallel optimization (NPO) strategy based on the ‘1+n’ mixed platoon concept, integrating Pontryagin’s minimum principle into a constrained control framework to jointly optimize speed planning and energy control of heterogeneous CAVs. The method reduces the control state-action dimensions while balancing traffic efficiency and fuel economy across intersections.
