# Our research
The long-term goals of our research are to advance intelligent autonomous systems by integrating reinforcement learning, modern control theory, and game-theoretic approaches for trustworthy human-robot collaboration. Our research centers on developing advanced control strategies for micro-mobility robots—including wheeled, humanoid, and quadrupedal platforms—to enhance their agility and manipulation in complex environments. We also explore multi-robot coordination and swarm intelligence to enable seamless teamwork among robot fleets. Additionally, we work on safe and energy-efficient control methods for connected and autonomous vehicles to promote sustainable urban mobility in large scale. Leveraging diverse robotic platforms and experimental facilities, ETAIC bridges cutting-edge theory with real-world applications to create intelligent agents capable of complex tasks.

#### We work with diverse robotic systems, drawn to the balance between theory and real-world challenges: as models improve, new complexities arise... revealing exciting opportunities... The lab leader blends industry experience with academic rigor, placing our work at the forefront of embodied AI and micro-mobility research.

### Safe Decision-Making and Control for Autonomous Vehicles in Interactive and Adverse Environments

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">

Our research addressed the core challenges in automated driving, including long-tail road scenarios, dynamic interactions with human agents, and reliable system validation. We explore the intersection of model-based control and data-driven intelligence to build resilient and adaptive autonomous vehicles.
Key Challenges:
- Long-Tail Distribution: Rare and unpredictable events in complex or adverse driving environments.
- Interactive Environments: Safe negotiation with human drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.
- Testing & Validation: Balancing high performance with robustness under real-world uncertainties.
Our Approach:
- Hybrid Intelligence: Integrating structured models with real-world data to improve adaptability and robustness.
- Hierarchical Architecture: Combining strategic planning with reactive control through cognitive and embodied intelligence layers.
- Safety by Design: Embedding multi-layer safety mechanisms to ensure both proactive and reactive hazard mitigation.

### Using multi-temperature X-ray data collection methods in mechanistic studies and ligand discovery campaigns

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">

We recognized that the standard practice of cryocooling crystals could distort protein conformations.
In both larger surveys and isolated mechanistic studies, we have demonstrated the value of room temperature data collection for revealing the structural basis of protein conformational dynamics, leading to new insights into enzymes, and increasing connections to dynamics studies from NMR and simulations.
Additionally, we have identified how temperature can bias small molecule discovery, leading some fragment sites inaccessible at cryogenic temperatures and repositioning critical water molecules.

### Determining structures that influence microbial-host interactions

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1 ">

We are interested in the structural enzymology and potential therapeutic applications of the human enzymes that degrade chitin, the pervasive polymer that can cause inflammation in the context of allergy and asthma. Using high resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we are studying the mechanisms of action to newly synthesized antibiotics (in collaboration with the [Seiple](https://seiplegroup.ucsf.edu/) and [Fujimori](https://fujimorilab.ucsf.edu) labs). With this platform, we are also pushing on cryo-EM data processing and refinement methods to enable structure-based drug design, now achieving resolutions better than 2.0 Å. With the improved molecules we generate, we are defining potential resistance mechanisms to these antibiotics using a combination of structural biology and deep mutational scanning experiments. In recent work, we are collaborating with the Bondy-Denomy lab to define the structural basis of anti-CRISPR proteins using a combination of X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, and NMR. The mechanism of action for many of these proteins remains mysterious.

### Identifying unifying concepts between systems and structural biology

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">


We are intrigued by the similarities in genetic epistasis and thermodynamic measurements and are applying these insights to large-scale studies of point mutants and posttranslational modifications. We attempt to connect the response to genetic (mutation), chemical (ligands), and physical (temperature) in experiments to define the basis of allosteric regulation and function. We like to bring an evolutionary biology perspective to the table to understand the relative importance of these different perturbations in shaping the proteins we see today.

### Creating new time-resolved experiments to probe correlated motions in proteins

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">

A major limitation of most biophysical techniques is the inability to directly reveal correlations in motions between distinct regions of macromolecules.
We are taking advantage of the new capabilities of next-generation X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL) light sources to perform radiation damage-free imaging of proteins and to watch how protein ensembles respond when perturbed by rapid temperature jumps using the X-FEL.
At equilibrium, X-ray diffuse scattering has the potential to reveal these motions; however, we currently lack the ability to collect, integrate, and refine diffuse scattering data.
Our long-term goal is to increase the information content of every X-ray diffraction experiment to reveal atomic level coupling at high resolution and improved models of grouped flexibility at low resolution.
