The ETAIC Lab is committed to fostering an inclusive, collaborative, and supportive research environment that values both technical excellence and human connection.
##### Read more about [our lab research diractions.](/research/)

We are always open to hearing from highly motivated individuals who share our passion for intelligent autonomy, control theory, and human-centered robotics. Even if a specific opening is not posted, we encourage interested candidates to reach out and start a conversation about research fit and career goals. We strive to provide excellent training across a wide range of research and experimental techniques. If interested please send your CV/Resume to [Prof. H. Eric Tseng](/contact).


## Graduate Students

ETAIC Lab accepts Ph.D. students through the graduate programs at the University of Texas at Arlington. If you are interested in pursuing a Ph.D. with us, please apply to the appropriate graduate program and indicate your interest in working with our lab in your statement of purpose. We welcome students with interests in reinforcement learning, robotics, intelligent transportation systems, or human-machine collaboration. We aim to provide rigorous training in both theoretical and applied aspects of embodied AI and intelligent control.


## Postdoctoral Fellows

We welcome postdoctoral researchers with a strong background in control systems, robotics, machine learning, or related areas. Interested candidates should email Prof. Hongtei Eric Tseng with a CV, a description of research interests, and potential project ideas. We support postdocs in developing independent research profiles and in pursuing external fellowships when appropriate.

## Other Visitors

In the past, our lab has enjoyed having foreign exchange students, interns, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry, and post-bac research specialists in the lab.  We are open to other arrangements as well. As we expect people to be fairly compensated for their work by their home institution or by us, we do not have volunteer positions available. 

**We take high school students exclusively through UCSF affiliated programs, e.g. [SEP](http://sep.ucsf.edu/), [BAYS](https://pharm.ucsf.edu/bays).** We cannot accomodate high school students outside of these programs and do not have volunteer positions for high school students.
