Even if a specific opening is not posted, we encourage interested candidates to reach out and start a conversation about research fit and career goals. We strive to provide excellent training across a wide range of research and experimental techniques. If interested please send your CV/Resume to [Prof. H. Eric Tseng](/contact).


## Graduate Students

ETAIC Lab accepts Ph.D. students through the graduate programs at the University of Texas at Arlington. If you are interested in pursuing a Ph.D. with us, please apply to the appropriate graduate program and indicate your interest in working with our lab in your statement of purpose. We welcome students with interests in reinforcement learning, robotics, intelligent transportation systems, or human-machine collaboration. We aim to provide rigorous training in both theoretical and applied aspects of embodied AI and intelligent control.


## Postdoctoral Fellows

We welcome postdoctoral researchers with a strong background in control systems, robotics, machine learning, or related areas. Interested candidates should email Prof. Hongtei Eric Tseng with a CV, a description of research interests, and potential project ideas. We support postdocs in developing independent research profiles and in pursuing external fellowships when appropriate.

## Other Visitors

ETAIC Lab has hosted research interns, visiting scholars, and international collaborators from both academia and industry. If you are interested in a short-term research visit or internship, please contact us with a CV and a brief proposal outlining your interests and funding source.
